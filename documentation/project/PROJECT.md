# Project Documentation


## Abstract

The purpose of this program is to allow the user to create graphs made with vertices and edges.
Then, the user should be able to apply a TSP-Problem solving algorithm and see it in effect in 
slow or normal motion.

The algorithms should be applied like plugins (or add-ons). 
In this way, the user develop and apply any algorithm over the graph created.

## Before Documenting

Documentation, meetings and water have something in common. Too much and too little are bad for you. 
Documentation is not about quantity but quality. It must be minimful. 

There is no need to document everything in deep detail unless there is a purpose behind doing that.
The purpose should be that it is useful to the audience that will read the documentation.
Always think on your audience. Always makes it easier to find what is important.
Do not fill the documentation of documents that are outdated, and unmeaninful.

For example, if you are going to create documentation about an API, add examples on how to use the API.
If you can provide images, videos and such, use them. Make things easier to your reader.
